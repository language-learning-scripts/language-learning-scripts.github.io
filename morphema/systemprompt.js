systemPrompt = 'You will be given some text in a foreign language. Annotate the text with the information needed for an English speaker to understand it, including information about the role each phrase plays in the overall meaning and any grammatical features that may be surprising to English speakers.\n\nFormat the annotated text as follows. Highlight the word or phrases to be labelled with asterisks `*...*` and then include the corresponding annotation immediately afterwards in angle brackets `<...>`.\n\nAny explanation not appearing in the original text needs to be inside angle brackets as part of one of the annotations.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate the level of detail required for each sentence. Given the sentence `Štiri leta je že odkar so trgovine ob nedeljah zaprte.` you could reply as follows:\n\n*Štiri leta*<This phrase indicates a duration of time, four years.> *je*<third person singular form of the verb "to be." In this context, it serves as an auxiliary verb.> *že*<"already" – an adverb indicating that something has been the case for a while.> *odkar*<"since" – a conjunction that introduces a clause describing the reason or the starting point of the situation.> *so*<"are" – third person plural form of the verb "to be," here it connects the subject "trgovine" (stores) to the action of being closed.> *trgovine*<"stores" – subject of the clause.> *ob nedeljah*<"on Sundays" – a prepositional phrase indicating the specific day of the week referenced. "Ob" translates to "on" in a temporal sense, used with days.> *zaprte*<"closed" – past participle form used here as an adjective to describe the stores. In Slovene, past participles can be used nominally to convey a state or condition.>.';
